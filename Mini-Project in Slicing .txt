Mini Project: Analyzing Sales Data
Suppose you have sales data for two products (Product A and Product B) over several months. Each row represents a month, and each column represents the sales for a specific product.

import numpy as np

# Sales data for two products over 6 months
sales_data = np.array([
    [100, 120, 80, 90, 110],
    [90, 85, 110, 120, 95],
    [75, 100, 90, 80, 85],
    [110, 95, 120, 100, 105],
    [95, 110, 85, 90, 80],
    [120, 80, 105, 110, 100]
])

# Extracting data for Product A and Product B
product_a_sales = sales_data[:, 0]  # All rows, first column
product_b_sales = sales_data[:, 1]  # All rows, second column

# Calculating total sales for each product
total_sales_product_a = np.sum(product_a_sales)
total_sales_product_b = np.sum(product_b_sales)

# Displaying the results
print("Sales Data:")
print(sales_data)
print("\nProduct A Sales:")
print(product_a_sales)
print("\nProduct B Sales:")
print(product_b_sales)
print("\nTotal Sales for Product A:", total_sales_product_a)
print("Total Sales for Product B:", total_sales_product_b)

Explanation:

We create a 2D NumPy array sales_data representing the sales data for two products over six months.

We use array slicing to extract the sales data for each product separately (product_a_sales and product_b_sales).

We calculate the total sales for each product using the np.sum function.

Finally, we display the original sales data, individual product sales, and the total sales for each product.
