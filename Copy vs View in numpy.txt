Mini Project: Copy vs View in NumPy

import numpy as np

# Creating a 2D NumPy array
original_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Creating a copy of the original array
copied_array = original_array.copy()

# Creating a view of the original array
view_array = original_array.view()

# Modifying the original array
original_array[0, 0] = 99

# Displaying the arrays
print("Original Array:")
print(original_array)

print("\nCopied Array:")
print(copied_array)

print("\nView Array:")
print(view_array)



Explanation:

We create a 2D NumPy array original_array.

We create a copy of the original array using the copy() method, resulting in copied_array.

We create a view of the original array using the view() method, resulting in view_array.

We modify the first element of the original array to 99.

We display the original array, copied array, and view array.

Results:

The copied_array is completely independent of the original array. Changes to the original array do not affect the copied array.

The view_array is a view of the original array. Changes to the original array affect the view array.

In the project, notice that modifying the original array does not affect the copied array, but it does affect the view array. Understanding when to use a copy and when to use a view is crucial in preventing unexpected changes to your data.

Feel free to experiment with the code and try additional modifications to better understand the concepts of copy and view in NumPy.
